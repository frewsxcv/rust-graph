# rust-graph

Status: I had a work-in-progress graph crate I was working on, but then found out about [petgraph](https://github.com/bluss/petgraph) which I've been using. Since then, I haven't had much of a need for the crates.io 'graph' name, so if someone else has a Rust graph library they're working on and want the crates.io name, feel free to open an issue in this repo.
